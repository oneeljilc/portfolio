        Hi! My name is Jillian and I am a polymer scientist at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) in New Mexico. 
        I run a mechanical testing lab where I get paid to crush things and/or pull them apart (Think 
        Hydraulic Press Channel on Youtube). In my lab, we get to study specialty polymer materials for a 
        variety of unique national security applications. It is a fun challenge and every day is different! 
        Approximately 8 years ago, I became interested in data management and got involved in 
        database-building efforts at LANL. Today, I co-lead a team under a digital transformation initiative
        that is building "AI-ready" material science datasets for the entire US Nuclear Security Enterprise 
        (NSE). It is this passion for data management that has inspired me to pursue a Master's Degree in
        Data Science from the University of California - San Diego with an expected graduation date of March 
        2026.

        Outside of work, I love hanging out with my husband, our 2.5 year old daughter, and our cat, Misty. 
        We enjoy adventures to the Zoo & Botanical Gardens, exploring our amazing libraries, and trying new 
        local restaurants. Although I donâ€™t have as much time for it these days, I also enjoy board games with 
        friends. Favorites include Gloomhaven, Terraforming Mars, & Tokaido.
